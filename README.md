# Donors-Choose-Application-Screening-Kaggle
Kaggle problem where we had to predict whether or not a DonorsChoose.org project proposal submitted by a teacher will be approved, using the text of project descriptions as well as additional metadata about the project, teacher, and school. Got an accuracy of 0.7748 with the uploaded Jupyter notebook.
